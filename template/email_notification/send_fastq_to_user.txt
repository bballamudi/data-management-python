You will find following information under the lane level tar files:
  - Fastq files
  - Demuliplexing report
  - Manifest file containing the md5 checksum of the fastq files
  - Samplesheet file for the flowcell lane

Please refer to the sample sheet extracts in the sample folders for facility sample ID to user sample name mappings.

We have updated our QC report page for the fastq files and included following
  - Analysis results from FastQC and Fastqscreen
  - MultiQC report for both known and undetermined indexes barcodes per flowcell lane
  - Improved html report for sequencing run level and lane level overview
  - Demultiplexing report generated by Illumina software per lane

Please have look and send us your feedback.
