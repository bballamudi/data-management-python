Quick data transfer tips for CX1/AX4 (Imperial College's HPC cluster) users:
  - module load irods/4.2.0
  - iget -Pr /igfZone/home/{{ customerUsername }}/{{ projectName }}/fastq/{{ projectRunDate }}/{{ flowcellId }}

Irods server downtime:
  Irods server will not be available for file transfer from 1st December 2018, due to relocation of the server to new data center. This server is expected to back online within two weeks, but in case of any technical difficulties, all services may not be restored before Christmas. Please take backup copies of your raw data and qc reports, as soon as you receive notification about data availability.
  
The data will be available for one month from the date of this e-mail. You can refer to the samplesheets in the fastq tarfiles for mapping facility sample ids to the original sample names.

We have updated our QC report page for the fastq files and included following details
  - A project summary view showing read counts (click on the 'Project Home')
  - Sample QC results from FastQC and FastQ Screen
  - MultiQC report for both known and undetermined indexes barcodes per flowcell lane
  - Improved html report for sequencing run level and lane level overview
  - Demultiplexing report generated by Illumina software per lane

Please have look and send us your feedback.


Kind regards
