Dear {{ customerName }},<p/>
<p/>
We would like to inform you that we are now preparing for data clean up for the following old projects from our servers.<p/>
<p/>
<b>List of projects:</b><p/><ul>{% for p in projectList %}
<li><b>{{ p }}</b></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul><p/>
It would be great if you could check and confirm by <span style="color:red"><b>{{ projectDeadline }}</b></span>, if you need copies for any of these projects. Otherwise, we will <span style="color:red"><b>REMOVE</b></span> the raw and analysis data for them after this deadline.<p/>
Imperial College now offers a dedicated storage solution for the hpc:<p/>
<p/><ul>
<li><b>Research data store:</b> <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/rds/">https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/rds/</a></li>
</ul><p/>
We can help you to back up your data into this new system, if you have an active project RDS space available.
<p/>
Please follow the instructions for "Imperial College Research Data Store based transfer" from this page and inform us regarding your new RDS storage path for data back up service.
<p/><ul>

</ul><p/>
You need to confirm this before <span style="color:red"><b>{{ projectDeadline }}</b></span>. <b>We will mark this project for clean up unless we get any response from you</b>.
<p/>
<p/>
Kind regards</p>
